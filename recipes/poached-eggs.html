    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Today we are going to learn how to make
        <strong>Poached Eggs</strong>. Let's look at the ingredients list and get started.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large sauce pan with 2 to 3 inches water and bring to a boil over high heat</li>
        <li>Once it starts boiling, reduce heat to medium-low and pour in your vinegar and salt</li>
        <li>Keep the water at a gentle simmer</li>
